[TITLE_1]Millions of vulnerable children worldwide are being failed as institutions scramble to develop costly schemes, squandering resources and hindering progress. Imposing an education tax on the G20 to precipitate yet another international organization would reiterate past failures without yielding any meaningful improvement. A new organization would inevitably fragment aid and would fail to teach students, wasting resources on bureaucracy and infeasible projects. Even more concerning is the fact that 30% of global development aid is siphoned off by corrupt individuals and organizations with conflicting agendas, diverting attention away from education (Kirya 5). Beyond feasibility and corruption, it is indefensible to establish an organization that drains taxpayer earnings while infringing on national sovereignty.[LEFT_COMMENT_1][RIGHT_COMMENT_1][RIGHT_COMMENT_2][LEFT_COMMENT_2][PAUSE] This resolution attempts to resolve a largely nonexistent funding issue, while the catalyst of the education crisis is a lack of accountability.[LEFT_COMMENT_3] We oppose the 1% global education tax because of its lack of feasibility and institutional shortcomings, its vulnerability to corruption and mismanagement, and the importance of national duty and sovereignty. 
[TITLE_2]The subway had stopped just after Queen Station.[LEFT_COMMENT_4] At first, nobody was concerned; just a usual delay on Line 1. The monotonous announcement that our train was delayed blared through the speakers.[RIGHT_COMMENT_3][LEFT_COMMENT_5] Everyone sighed, rolled their eyes, and went back to looking at their phones. The atmosphere was thick. It was one of those Toronto evenings where everything felt damp: the seats, the subway straps, and your own skin. I had my headphones on—but no music—just to block out the world.[LEFT_COMMENT_6] Five minutes passed. Then ten. The AC gave up with a click. The silence was peaceful, or so I thought. Someone coughed. Another person muttered something unintelligible. A panhandler moved between train cars; he was loud and persistent, his voice echoing off the walls. Today was his lucky day—people reached into their pockets eagerly, not out of generosity but to make him leave sooner. Clink. Clink. Clink.[LEFT_COMMENT_7] The sound was sharp and subtle, with everyone paying for silence.[RIGHT_COMMENT_4] By twenty minutes, people started shifting; checking their phones and trying to connect to the failing internet, signal bars stuck empty. The intercom buzzed static, then the same prosaic announcement as earlier. A guy in a suit banged on the door. “How long is this gonna take?!” he hollered. No answer. Somewhere behind me, a baby began to cry. Its mother rocked it while its shriek pierced the air.[RIGHT_COMMENT_5][LEFT_COMMENT_8] She attempted to soothe it with soft and gentle words, but her voice was uneasy as well. That was when the heat began to creep in, making us feel like dogs in a hot car. People fanned themselves, loosened their clothing, and drank the lukewarm water that they had.[RIGHT_COMMENT_6][LEFT_COMMENT_9] The lights flickered—first on one car, then on all of them simultaneously. Every time they did, the air thickened, and breathing became more difficult. “Can someone help us out of here?!” someone implored. “Only the operator can,” answered another. What if the operator was gone? I thought to myself. People began to laugh as if they had heard—or understood—what I had just thought. It was the kind of nervous laughter that people used to drown dread. A man in a Jays jersey started pacing. “This isn’t normal,” he repeated over and over again. “Maintenance issues don’t take this long,” he said after a minute. Someone told him to relax. He didn’t.[RIGHT_COMMENT_7] Minutes went by. The windows—which were usually tinted gray and allowed some light to pass through—were pitch black. Nothing but the tunnel was outside. Just the faint buzz of the generator keeping the emergency lights on. Not that they were of much use, anyway. Then the first phone died, going out with a short chime. Someone swore. Another reached for a charger from their bag, before realizing that there was nowhere to plug it into. That's when the murmuring started—not conversation, but the undertone of low voices through the train car. “It could be a fire up ahead.” “No, they’d tell us if that was happening.” “Maybe they can’t evacuate us.” “What if it’s a bomb?”[LEFT_COMMENT_10] Each theory was progressively worse, no one denying any of them. A kid, about sixteen, started recording himself. “If everyone here dies, they’ll still take weeks to find our bodies,” he snickered. Nobody told him to stop. The lights flickered again, this time reverting to dim orange—only enough to see the outline of shapes. Voices sharpened. A group accused someone of purposefully bumping into them. Someone else shouted at a boy for kicking her seat. Near me, an elderly woman was pushed off her seat by a young man. Those who stepped in were snapped at for taking sides. The man in the Jays jersey slammed his fist against the subway door. “They’re leaving us here to die!” A few older passengers told him to stop, yet he continued yelling, his head shuddering violently. The baby cried, this time harsher than the last. “Make it stop!” the guy in the suit yowled. The mother clutched her baby tighter. “He’s just scared—” “We are too!” the man cut in. Just then, all the lights flickered out, defusing the argument. When they came back, the boy who’d been livestreaming had disappeared. I swear he’d been standing beside the centre pole, but all that was left was empty space. I barely had time to question it before the train lurched forward, another announcement finally playing on the loudspeaker. No one cheered or spoke. In fact, everything looked… normal.[LEFT_COMMENT_11] People standing and using their phones, faces expressionless. When the train rolled into Dundas Station, everyone rushed to exit. I stumbled onto the platform and took off my headphones, a dramatic cacophony greeting my ears. Behind me, the train doors slid shut, just like normal. The overhead voice warned, “Please stand clear of the doors.” And this time, I listened.[RIGHT_COMMENT_8][LEFT_COMMENT_12]
[TITLE_3]Small Modular Reactors: A Modern Solution to a Growing Urban Energy Issue As energy grids struggle to meet rising power demand, governments and corporations are focusing on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), compact nuclear energy systems designed to supply large amounts of power without the environmental footprint of traditional sources. With modern cities consuming more energy than ever through data centres and transit networks, the strain on existing grids is becoming unbearable. SMRs fill this gap with clean and consistent energy production, giving cities the ability to fulfill rising power demand. Overall, Small Modular Reactors are the ideal urban energy source of the future, as they produce energy efficiently and withstand challenges resiliently. Consequently, increased investment in SMR technology will lead to a more robust energy grid in cities. One of the main reasons that SMRs stand out is their ability to produce energy more efficiently than traditional sources or conventional nuclear power plants. This is because SMRs can power entire grids while consuming fewer resources than alternate methods of energy production. Their efficiency is exemplified by the fact that one SMR can produce up to 7.2 million kilowatt-hours of energy per day—to compare, the typical Ontario household consumes 750 kilowatt-hours of energy per month (Ontario Energy Board 9). Most critically, a single SMR could provide power for a small city, and could be relocated depending on energy demand (Government of Ontario). The reduced complexity of energy grids in communities with fewer power sources also results in increased cost-awareness and lower long-term maintenance costs. Aside from simplicity, SMRs also provide various cost benefits. According to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report, “SMR designs will allow builders to take advantage of economies of mass production” (IAEA 22). The cost reductions as more SMRs are produced means that they are especially economical for large cities where multiple units can be used together or apart, depending on the availability of land. In addition to reduced unit costs, nuclear power is also inexpensive in the long term due to low fuel costs (World Nuclear Association). The reduced energy production costs within communities will also carry over to reduce energy bills for everyday citizens. Overall, both the simplicity and cost benefits of SMRs demonstrate that they are more efficient than other energy sources. These efficiency benefits ultimately highlight the need for increased investment in SMR technology for use in urban areas. In addition to their efficiency advantages, SMRs also handle challenges with their resilience, justifying the need for greater investment into the technology. SMRs exhibit resilience that makes them valuable for urban energy planning, as they are engineered with systems to ensure safety in spite of adversities that would threaten other energy sources. For example, SMR safety systems rely on natural constants such as gravity and convection (Liou). This means that SMRs are designed to automatically initiate emergency procedures if anomalies occur, reducing the risk of large-scale failures—unlike other energy sources that rely on human intervention or external power. SMRs can also be positioned in underground facilities, protecting them from adverse weather, seismic activity, and violent attacks (U.S. Department of Energy). Aside from their resilience to anomalies, SMRs provide a reliable and consistent power supply—perfect for cities that consume large amounts of power both night and day. One of the reasons for this is that SMRs can store fuel for up to a decade without needing to refuel on enriched uranium. Moreover, SMRs can be refuelled or maintained in a staggered manner, so that power is supplied constantly throughout a region (U.S. Department of Energy). These benefits highlight that SMRs would face less consistency issues compared to larger plants, which need to be shut down during large-scale operations. SMRs are also advantageous relative to alternative energy sources such as wind or solar power, as they can operate all day long, regardless of the weather. Both safety and consistency benefits underscore the need for the expanded development of SMR technology. Ultimately, increased investment in SMR technology would strengthen the reliability of power grids in both small and large cities alike. To conclude, Small Modular Reactors present a practical solution to the urban energy issue, and have the potential to satisfy the ever-increasing demand for power in cities. Their unmatched efficiency, demonstrated by their high energy output and decreasing unit costs, make them a suitable addition to existing energy grids. Furthermore, their innate resilience to adversities makes them a safe and reliable source of energy, proving that SMRs are capable of handling high energy demands. As cities continue to grow and expand, investing in SMR technology will become even more necessary to alleviate the energy crisis. Therefore, strengthening urban energy grids with SMRs will ensure efficient and reliable power for decades to come.
