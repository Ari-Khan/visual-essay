[PAUSE][TITLE_1]Millions of vulnerable children worldwide are being failed as institutions scramble to develop costly schemes, squandering resources and hindering progress. Imposing an education tax on the G20 to precipitate yet another international organization would reiterate past failures without yielding any meaningful improvement. A new organization would inevitably fragment aid and would fail to teach students, wasting resources on bureaucracy and infeasible projects. Even more concerning is the fact that 30% of global development aid is siphoned off by corrupt individuals and organizations with conflicting agendas, diverting attention away from education (Kirya 5). Beyond feasibility and corruption, it is indefensible to establish an organization that drains taxpayer earnings while infringing on national sovereignty.[LEFT_COMMENT_1][RIGHT_COMMENT_1][RIGHT_COMMENT_2][LEFT_COMMENT_2][PAUSE] This resolution attempts to resolve a largely nonexistent funding issue, while the catalyst of the education crisis is a lack of accountability.[LEFT_COMMENT_3] We oppose the 1% global education tax because of its lack of feasibility and institutional shortcomings, its vulnerability to corruption and mismanagement, and the importance of national duty and sovereignty. 
[PAUSE][TITLE_2]The subway had stopped just after Queen Station.[LEFT_COMMENT_4] At first, nobody was concerned; just a usual delay on Line 1. The monotonous announcement that our train was delayed blared through the speakers.[RIGHT_COMMENT_3][LEFT_COMMENT_5] Everyone sighed, rolled their eyes, and went back to looking at their phones. The atmosphere was thick. It was one of those Toronto evenings where everything felt damp: the seats, the subway straps, and your own skin. I had my headphones on—but no music—just to block out the world.[LEFT_COMMENT_6] Five minutes passed. Then ten. The AC gave up with a click. The silence was peaceful, or so I thought. Someone coughed. Another person muttered something unintelligible. A panhandler moved between train cars; he was loud and persistent, his voice echoing off the walls. Today was his lucky day—people reached into their pockets eagerly, not out of generosity but to make him leave sooner. Clink. Clink. Clink.[LEFT_COMMENT_7] The sound was sharp and subtle, with everyone paying for silence.[RIGHT_COMMENT_4] By twenty minutes, people started shifting; checking their phones and trying to connect to the failing internet, signal bars stuck empty. The intercom buzzed static, then the same prosaic announcement as earlier. A guy in a suit banged on the door. “How long is this gonna take?!” he hollered. No answer. Somewhere behind me, a baby began to cry. Its mother rocked it while its shriek pierced the air.[RIGHT_COMMENT_5][LEFT_COMMENT_8] She attempted to soothe it with soft and gentle words, but her voice was uneasy as well. That was when the heat began to creep in, making us feel like dogs in a hot car. People fanned themselves, loosened their clothing, and drank the lukewarm water that they had.[RIGHT_COMMENT_6][LEFT_COMMENT_9] The lights flickered—first on one car, then on all of them simultaneously. Every time they did, the air thickened, and breathing became more difficult. “Can someone help us out of here?!” someone implored. “Only the operator can,” answered another. What if the operator was gone? I thought to myself. People began to laugh as if they had heard—or understood—what I had just thought. It was the kind of nervous laughter that people used to drown dread. A man in a Jays jersey started pacing. “This isn’t normal,” he repeated over and over again. “Maintenance issues don’t take this long,” he said after a minute. Someone told him to relax. He didn’t.[RIGHT_COMMENT_7] Minutes went by. The windows—which were usually tinted gray and allowed some light to pass through—were pitch black. Nothing but the tunnel was outside. Just the faint buzz of the generator keeping the emergency lights on. Not that they were of much use, anyway. Then the first phone died, going out with a short chime. Someone swore. Another reached for a charger from their bag, before realizing that there was nowhere to plug it into. That's when the murmuring started—not conversation, but the undertone of low voices through the train car. “It could be a fire up ahead.” “No, they’d tell us if that was happening.” “Maybe they can’t evacuate us.” “What if it’s a bomb?”[LEFT_COMMENT_10] Each theory was progressively worse, no one denying any of them. A kid, about sixteen, started recording himself. “If everyone here dies, they’ll still take weeks to find our bodies,” he snickered. Nobody told him to stop. The lights flickered again, this time reverting to dim orange—only enough to see the outline of shapes. Voices sharpened. A group accused someone of purposefully bumping into them. Someone else shouted at a boy for kicking her seat. Near me, an elderly woman was pushed off her seat by a young man. Those who stepped in were snapped at for taking sides. The man in the Jays jersey slammed his fist against the subway door. “They’re leaving us here to die!” A few older passengers told him to stop, yet he continued yelling, his head shuddering violently. The baby cried, this time harsher than the last. “Make it stop!” the guy in the suit yowled. The mother clutched her baby tighter. “He’s just scared—” “We are too!” the man cut in. Just then, all the lights flickered out, defusing the argument. When they came back, the boy who’d been livestreaming had disappeared. I swear he’d been standing beside the centre pole, but all that was left was empty space. I barely had time to question it before the train lurched forward, another announcement finally playing on the loudspeaker. No one cheered or spoke. In fact, everything looked… normal.[LEFT_COMMENT_11] People standing and using their phones, faces expressionless. When the train rolled into Dundas Station, everyone rushed to exit. I stumbled onto the platform and took off my headphones, a dramatic cacophony greeting my ears. Behind me, the train doors slid shut, just like normal. The overhead voice warned, “Please stand clear of the doors.” And this time, I listened.[RIGHT_COMMENT_8][LEFT_COMMENT_12]
[PAUSE][TITLE_3]Small Modular Reactors: A Modern Solution to a Growing Urban Energy Issue As energy grids struggle to meet rising power demand, governments and corporations are focusing on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), compact nuclear energy systems designed to supply large amounts of power without the environmental footprint of traditional sources.[LEFT_COMMENT_13] With modern cities consuming more energy than ever through data centres and transit networks, the strain on existing grids is becoming unbearable. SMRs fill this gap with clean and consistent energy production, giving cities the ability to fulfill rising power demand. Overall, Small Modular Reactors are the ideal urban energy source of the future, as they produce energy efficiently and withstand challenges resiliently. Consequently, increased investment in SMR technology will lead to a more robust energy grid in cities.[RIGHT_COMMENT_9] One of the main reasons that SMRs stand out is their ability to produce energy more efficiently than traditional sources or conventional nuclear power plants. This is because SMRs can power entire grids while consuming fewer resources than alternate methods of energy production. Their efficiency is exemplified by the fact that one SMR can produce up to 7.2 million kilowatt-hours of energy per day—to compare, the typical Ontario household consumes 750 kilowatt-hours of energy per month (Ontario Energy Board 9).[RIGHT_COMMENT_10] Most critically, a single SMR could provide power for a small city, and could be relocated depending on energy demand (Government of Ontario). The reduced complexity of energy grids in communities with fewer power sources also results in increased cost-awareness and lower long-term maintenance costs. Aside from simplicity, SMRs also provide various cost benefits. According to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report, “SMR designs will allow builders to take advantage of economies of mass production” (IAEA 22). The cost reductions as more SMRs are produced means that they are especially economical for large cities where multiple units can be used together or apart, depending on the availability of land. In addition to reduced unit costs, nuclear power is also inexpensive in the long term due to low fuel costs (World Nuclear Association). The reduced energy production costs within communities will also carry over to reduce energy bills for everyday citizens. Overall, both the simplicity and cost benefits of SMRs demonstrate that they are more efficient than other energy sources. These efficiency benefits ultimately highlight the need for increased investment in SMR technology for use in urban areas.[RIGHT_COMMENT_11][LEFT_COMMENT_14] In addition to their efficiency advantages, SMRs also handle challenges with their resilience, justifying the need for greater investment into the technology. SMRs exhibit resilience that makes them valuable for urban energy planning, as they are engineered with systems to ensure safety in spite of adversities that would threaten other energy sources. For example, SMR safety systems rely on natural constants such as gravity and convection (Liou). This means that SMRs are designed to automatically initiate emergency procedures if anomalies occur, reducing the risk of large-scale failures—unlike other energy sources that rely on human intervention or external power. SMRs can also be positioned in underground facilities, protecting them from adverse weather, seismic activity, and violent attacks (U.S. Department of Energy). Aside from their resilience to anomalies, SMRs provide a reliable and consistent power supply—perfect for cities that consume large amounts of power both night and day. One of the reasons for this is that SMRs can store fuel for up to a decade without needing to refuel on enriched uranium. Moreover, SMRs can be refuelled or maintained in a staggered manner, so that power is supplied constantly throughout a region (U.S. Department of Energy). These benefits highlight that SMRs would face less consistency issues compared to larger plants, which need to be shut down during large-scale operations. SMRs are also advantageous relative to alternative energy sources such as wind or solar power, as they can operate all day long, regardless of the weather. Both safety and consistency benefits underscore the need for the expanded development of SMR technology.[LEFT_COMMENT_15] Ultimately, increased investment in SMR technology would strengthen the reliability of power grids in both small and large cities alike. To conclude, Small Modular Reactors present a practical solution to the urban energy issue, and have the potential to satisfy the ever-increasing demand for power in cities.[RIGHT_COMMENT_12] Their unmatched efficiency, demonstrated by their high energy output and decreasing unit costs, make them a suitable addition to existing energy grids. Furthermore, their innate resilience to adversities makes them a safe and reliable source of energy, proving that SMRs are capable of handling high energy demands. As cities continue to grow and expand, investing in SMR technology will become even more necessary to alleviate the energy crisis.[LEFT_COMMENT_16] Therefore, strengthening urban energy grids with SMRs will ensure efficient and reliable power for decades to come.[LEFT_COMMENT_17]
[PAUSE][TITLE_4]While good intentions are often praised, The Light Between Oceans demonstrates how actions driven by love and sorrow often result in moral harm. The Light Between Oceans follows Tom and Isabel Sherbourne, a couple living on the isolated Australian lighthouse of Janus Rock following World War I. Traumatized by loss and infertility, the couple decides to keep a baby who washes ashore in a boat, despite knowing that the child—who they name Lucy—may belong to someone else. Following an investigation, the couple is exposed for failing to report Lucy to the authorities, and Tom is incarcerated. Tom and Isabel’s decision to keep Lucy is driven by emotion rather than ethics, leading them to prioritize their feelings over what is morally right. Their continued secrecy about Lucy’s origins exacerbates the suffering of others, especially those who are unaware of their choice. Such decisions place immense strain on their marriage, revealing how immoral actions can devastate interpersonal relationships. Ultimately, The Light Between Oceans demonstrates how good intentions cannot justify immoral choices, as Tom and Isabel’s decision to keep Lucy is driven by emotion, their secrecy exacerbates the harm of others, and their actions devastate their relationship. Therefore, impulsive decisions made based on one’s own moral convictions are morally apathetic, and result in the harm of others. Although Tom and Isabel’s decisions are well-intentioned, their emotional impulses make their actions morally indefensible, and harm others in the process. Their impulsive decisions are evident, as Isabel believes that the arrival of the baby is a miracle. After her miscarriages, she is convinced that Lucy is a “gift that’s been sent to [her]” (Stedman 98). Her belief that the baby has been sent to them by an omniscient being shows how her grief has clouded her judgment. On the other hand, Tom understands that they have a moral obligation to inform the authorities about the baby. The example shows that Isabel’s intentions are not inherently immoral, as she wants to raise the baby as a mother. She acts immoral only when she decides to keep the baby based on her emotions, without determining the ethicality of her decision. While Tom is more resistant, he finally agrees to Isabel’s wishes, thinking that “Perhaps she needed a bit of time with a baby” (Stedman 7). Tom, understanding Isabel’s grief, acts with good intentions to make Isabel feel happy. This leads him to let emotions guide his choices, and disregard morality. Ultimately, both the emotional impulses of Tom and Isabel exemplify how their actions are unjustified and immoral, showing how decisions evaluated based on intentions can still harm others. Besides their emotional impulses, the couple’s secrecy exacerbates the harm of others to the point that their actions are unjustifiable. This is exemplified by a conversation between Isabel and Ralph Addicott, who occasionally delivers supplies to Janus Rock. During the exchange, Ralph exclaims that “Everything [Isabel’s] done to help Lucy has hurt someone else” (Stedman 311). This reveals that while Isabel has raised Lucy with the utmost care, she has harmed others like Hannah, Lucy’s birth mother. Hannah, who believes that her child is dead, struggles with grief for the years before the couple is exposed. As Tom and Isabel keep Lucy, they exhibit a disregard for their moral responsibility to return Lucy, harming another parent in the process. While Isabel convinced herself that taking care of Lucy was well-intentioned, she ultimately acts immorally and harms Hannah. Another example of secrecy is an unexpected encounter between Isabel and Lucy, following the couple’s exposure. The author describes Hannah seeing “the evidence of all that had been stolen. … the hundreds of days and the thousands of embraces the two had shared—the love usurped” as Lucy runs to Isabel (Stedman 273). Hannah’s perspective epitomizes how she was robbed of her time with Lucy, and the embraces that the two shared. The encounter also shows how Lucy genuinely loves Isabel, and how Hannah has been deprived of her motherhood. This deprivation exemplifies how Isabel’s secrecy exacerbated the harm of Hannah, causing moral harm. Ultimately, both Isabel’s exchange with Ralph and her unexpected meeting with Lucy show how the couple’s secrecy exacerbates the harm of others. This indicates that actions must be evaluated by their morality, as Hannah suffers despite the couple’s good intentions. The exposure of Lucy’s origins devastates the couple’s relationship, revealing the personal cost of their decision. Even before their exposure, the author emphasizes the strain on the couple’s relationship, as they are divided on keeping Lucy or informing the authorities. The conflict between Tom and Isabel reaches its climax after the couple returns from the mainland, knowing that Hannah was Lucy’s original mother. Disagreeing with Isabel, Tom states that “We’re talking about a child’s life! And a woman’s life, for that matter. Every moment of our happiness is on her tab” (Stedman 182). While Isabel clings to Lucy as a response to her loss, Tom resists, overwhelmed by guilt and responsibility; his survivor’s guilt after the death of his compatriots aggravates this guilt. This guilt creates emotional distance between them, even before Tom is imprisoned. Regardless of Tom’s morality, the conflict between him and Isabel demonstrate how good intentions cannot justify immoral choices. Although Tom anticipates the harm Hannah may endure, his years of inaction reveal and ignorance of foreseeable harm. The exposure also affects Isabel greatly, and the author describes that “[Isabel’s] mind collapses under the weight of it, and her thoughts descend into a deep, black well, where shame and loss and fear begin to drown her” (Stedman 324). This moment illustrates Isabel’s realization that her love for Lucy has come at the expense of another mother’s suffering. Instead of arguing or rebelling, Isabel enters a state of shame, finally realizing the harm that she has inflicted on others. Isabel’s feelings reflect the guilt that the couple must face for the rest of their lives. It also shows how Isabel’s good intentions could not protect her from the feeling of sorrow. Ultimately, their fractured relationship shows how moral faults can erode the closest relationships. Overall, The Light Between Oceans illustrates that good intentions cannot justify immoral choices, as Tom and Isabel’s decision to keep Lucy is emotionally driven, and their secrecy aggravates the harm of others. The couple’s choices also damage their relationship, showing how even decision-makers are impacted by their unethical choices. Subsequently, others are harmed by decisions made solely from one’s own perspective on ethics. Contributing to the immorality of their choices is the couple prioritizing their emotions over ethics. Their failure to reveal Lucy’s origins increases the sorrow of those who are unaware of their choice. Their decisions lead to conflict that harms their marriage, the effect of immoral actions on relationships. The Light Between Oceans demonstrates how decision-makers must evaluate their intentions alongside the morality of their actions. This prevents the unintentional harm of others and leads to empathetic decision-making that encompasses the full scope of a situation. All in all, by prioritizing morality, well-intentioned decisions can reciprocate the same love that drives them.
