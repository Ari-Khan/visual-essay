[TITLE_1]Millions of vulnerable children worldwide are being failed as institutions scramble to develop costly schemes, squandering resources and hindering progress. Imposing an education tax on the G20 to precipitate yet another international organization would reiterate past failures without yielding any meaningful improvement. A new organization would inevitably fragment aid and would fail to teach students, wasting resources on bureaucracy and infeasible projects. Even more concerning is the fact that 30% of global development aid is siphoned off by corrupt individuals and organizations with conflicting agendas, diverting attention away from education (Kirya 5). Beyond feasibility and corruption, it is indefensible to establish an organization that drains taxpayer earnings while infringing on national sovereignty. We oppose the 1% global education tax because of its lack of feasibility and institutional shortcomings, its vulnerability to corruption and mismanagement, and the importance of national duty and sovereignty.[LEFT_COMMENT_1][RIGHT_COMMENT_1][RIGHT_COMMENT_2][LEFT_COMMENT_2][PAUSE][DELETE_LAST_SENTENCE][PAUSE] This resolution attempts to resolve a largely nonexistent funding issue, while the catalyst of the education crisis is a lack of accountability. We oppose the 1% global education tax because of its lack of feasibility and institutional shortcomings, its vulnerability to corruption and mismanagement, and the importance of national duty and sovereignty.
